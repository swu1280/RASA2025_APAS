Consultations
Complaint by the United States.

On 17 September 2012, the United States requested consultations with China concerning certain measures providing subsidies in the form of grants, loans, forgone government revenue, the provision of goods and services, and other incentives contingent upon export performance to automobile and automobile-parts enterprises in China.

The United States claims that the measures appear to be inconsistent with:

Articles 3, 25.1, 25.2, 25.3 and 25.4 of the SCM Agreement;
 
Article XVI:1 of the GATT 1994; and
 
Paragraphs 1.2, 2(C)(1) and 2(C)(2) of Part I of China's Accession Protocol.
On 28 September 2012, the European Union requested to join the consultations. Subsequently, China informed the DSB that it had accepted the request of the European Union to join the consultations.
