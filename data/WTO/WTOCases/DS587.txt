Complaint by China (See also DS543 and DS565)

On 2 September 2019, China requested consultations with the United States regarding tariff measures imposed by the United States on certain goods originating from China.

China claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with:

Articles I:1, II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994; and
Articles 23.1, 23.2(a), 23.2(b) and 23.2(c) of the DSU.
On 12 September 2019, the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate a communication where it indicated that it took note of additional tariffs imposed by China. The communication indicated that, at the consultations, the United States looked forward to hearing China's basis for imposing those additional tariffs. The communication concluded that the United States accepted China's request to enter into consultations and stood ready to confer on a mutually convenient date for those consultations.
