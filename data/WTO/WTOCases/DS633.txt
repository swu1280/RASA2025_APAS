Complaint by China

On 4 February 2025, China requested consultations with the United States with respect to tariff measures, consisting of a 10% additional tariff, on goods originating in China.

China claimed that the challenged measures appear to be inconsistent with Articles I:1, II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.

On 14 February 2025, the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication where it indicated that the United States accepted China's request to enter into consultations, without prejudice to the United States' view that the actions cited by China were issues of national security not susceptible to review or capable of resolution by WTO dispute settlement, or whether each of the items in China's request for consultations constituted a “measure” within the meaning of Article 4 of the DSU.

On 4 March 2025, China requested additional consultations that supplemented its request for consultations of 4 February 2025. China indicated that it was requesting consultations with the United States with respect to measures that increased the additional tariffs on goods originating in China from 10% to 20%, which appeared to be inconsistent with Articles I:1, II:1(a) and II:1(b) of the GATT 1994.
