Complaint by China

On 14 August 2018, China requested consultations with the United States concerning certain measures allegedly adopted and maintained by the governments of certain US states and municipalities in relation to alleged subsidies or alleged domestic content requirements in the energy sector.

China claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with:

Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement;
 
Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the TRIMS Agreement; and
 
Article III:4 of the GATT 1994.
On 24 August 2018, the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication where it indicated that the United States accepted China's request to enter into consultations.

On 24 August 2018, the European Union requested to join the consultations. On 22 October 2018, the United States informed the DSB that it had accepted the request.
