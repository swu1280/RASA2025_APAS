Consultations
Complaint by China

On 26 March 2024, China requested consultations with the United States with respect to certain subsidies that the United States allegedly provides under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods or that otherwise discriminate against goods of Chinese origin. These comprise: (i) the Clean Vehicle Credit; and (ii) the Renewable Energy Tax Credits (including the Investment Tax Credit for Energy Property; the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit; the Production Tax Credit for Electricity from Renewables; and the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit).

China claimed that the challenged measures appear to be inconsistent with:

Article III:4 of the GATT 1994;
 
Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the TRIMS Agreement; and
 
Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement.
In addition, China claimed that the Clean Vehicle Credit appears to be inconsistent with Article I:1 of the GATT 1994.

On 5 April 2024, the United States requested the Chair of the DSB to circulate to Members a communication where it indicated that the United States accepted China's request to enter into consultations, without prejudice to whether each of the items in China's consultations request constituted a “measure” within the meaning of Article 4 of the DSU, or whether the request raised issues of national security not susceptible to review or capable of resolution by WTO dispute settlement.
