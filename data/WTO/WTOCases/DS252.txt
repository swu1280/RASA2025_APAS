Panel and Appellate Body proceedings
The DSB established a single Panel, pursuant to an agreement between the parties and in accordance with Article 9.1 of the DSU.

The Members which had reserved their third-party rights in the Panels established at the request of these parties were also considered as third parties in the single Panel. Canada, Chinese Taipei, Cuba, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela have reserved their rights to participate in the Panel proceedings as a third party.

On 15 July 2002, the DSB was notified of a procedural agreement between the United States and the European Communities, Japan, Korea, China, Switzerland, Norway and New Zealand. On 18 July 2002, the DSB was notified of a procedural agreement between the United States and Brazil.

On 15 July 2002, the European Communities, Japan, Korea, China, Switzerland, Norway and New Zealand requested the Director-General to determine the composition of the Panel. On 25 July 2002, the Panel was composed.

On 23 October 2002, Malaysia decided to withdraw as a third party from the panel proceedings.

On 20 February 2003, the Chairman of the Panel informed the DSB that the Panel would not be able to complete its work in six months due to the volume, complexities and sensitivity of the legal and factual questions that had been raised. The Panel hoped to complete its work by the end of April 2003.

The Panel circulated its Reports1   to Members on 11 July 2003. The Panel concluded that all the United States’ safeguard measures at issue were inconsistent with at least one of the following WTO pre-requisites for the imposition of a safeguard measure: lack of demonstration of (i) unforeseen developments; (ii) increased imports; (iii) causation; and (iv) parallelism. The Panel thus requested the United States to bring the relevant safeguard measures into conformity with its obligations under the Agreement on Safeguards and GATT 1994..

On 11 August 2003, the US notified its decision to appeal to the Appellate Body certain issues of law covered in the Panel Report and certain legal interpretations developed by the Panel.

On 8 October 2003, the Chairman of the Appellate Body informed the DSB that the Appellate Body would not be able to circulate its Report within 60 days due to the time required for completion and translation of the Report and that it estimated that the Appellate Body Report in this appeal would be circulated to WTO Members no later than 10 November 2003.

On 10 November 2003, the Appellate Body Report was circulated to Members. The Appellate Body upheld the Panel’s ultimate conclusions that each of the ten safeguard measures at issue in this dispute was inconsistent with the United States’ obligations under Article XIX:1(a) of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards. The Appellate Body reversed the Panel’s findings that the US failed to provide a reasoned and adequate explanation on “increased imports” and on the existence of a “causal link” between increased imports and serious injury for two of the ten safeguard measures. Ultimately, however, even these measures were found to be inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on other grounds.

At its meeting on 10 December 2003, the DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the Panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report.

Implementation of adopted reports
At the DSB meeting of 10 December 2003, the US informed Members that, on 4 December 2003, the President of the United States had issued a proclamation that terminated all of the safeguard measures subject to this dispute, pursuant to section 204 of the US Trade Act of 1974.

1. Although all complaints made by the eight co-complainants were considered in a single panel process, the United States requested the issuance of eight separate panel reports, claiming that to do otherwise would prejudice its WTO rights, including its right to settle the matter with individual complainants. The complainants vigorously opposed this request, stating that to grant it would only delay the panel process. The Panel decided to issue its decisions in the form of “one document constituting eight Panel Reports”. Thus, for WTO purposes, this document is deemed to be eight separate reports, relating to each of the eight complainants in this dispute. The document comprises a common cover page, a common descriptive part and a common set of findings. However, the document also contains conclusions and recommendations that are “particularized” for each of the complainants, with a separate number (symbol) for each individual complainant. In the Panel’s view, this approach respected the rights of all parties while ensuring the prompt and effective settlement of the disputes.
